When it comes to interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program it's important to understand is what the users want a need out of the software. Creating "user stories" help with the process because it gives the team user's perspective on what they are trying to do so that the team can put it into action. I approach developing programs by using the SDLC process which will help me every step of the way. I hope to incorporate all agile processes into my future development work to get the experience with working with a team on these different processes. It means to be a good team member in software development by focusing on team achievement rather than personal achievement.
